# Middle School Curriculum

As with the other grades, we are focused on three areas:

* What is technology?

* How do we use technology?

* How do we use technology well?

The classes will be split between instruction and lab work.  Hopefully this will keep the material engaging.  There are several small units we will be touching on throughout the course of the year, with a few one-off topics sprinkled throughout.  The topics include:

* Artificial Intelligence
* Programming
* Excel/Word/Power Point
* How does a computer work?
* Digital Citizenship

The digital citizenship lessons are coming from Common Sense Media.  I don't have these lessons grouped together, rather I shuffled them into the year.

I am still actively making changes to this curriculum, so things are subject to change.
