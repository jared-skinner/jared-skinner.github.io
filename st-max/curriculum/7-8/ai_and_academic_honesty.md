    * The more information, the better the prediction

    * ChatGPT consumed all of the internet!

    * This is just the beginning

* Demo

  * Funny example 

  * Math example 

  * History example 

  * English example

* Discuss strengths and weaknesses

* Discuss plagiarism 

  * Is it wrong to copy and paste ChatGPT output and call it our own?

  * Can we use ChatGPT to learn?
  
    * YES... but, we need to fact check!

    * This tool is not infallible 

    * Treat it like an expert who go hit in the head with a rock... It's know's its stuff pretty well, but it still says a bunch of dumb stuff.  

      * Example

* How should we use this tool?

  * Ask specific questions and ask for resources

  * Other tools are coming

    * Never assume these tools have your interests at heart.

    * ChatGPT appears to be pretty benign, but don't trust this 

    * Always assume that these tools have an agenda behind them and were trained accordingly

      * Taught differently

    * Be cautious!

    * The deck is stacked against you!
